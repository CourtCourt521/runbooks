# KubeVirtVMStuckInMigratingState
<!-- Edited by apinnick, Nov 2022 -->

## Meaning

This alert fires when a virtual machine (VM) is in a migrating state for more
than 5 minutes.

This alert might indicate a problem in the cluster infrastructure, such as network
disruptions or insufficient node resources.

## Impact

There is no immediate impact. However, if this alert persists, you must
investigate the root cause and resolve the issue.

## Diagnosis

1. Check the node resources:

   ```bash
   $ oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker= -o json | jq '.items | \
     .[].status.allocatable'
   ```

   Example output:

   ```json
   {
      "cpu": "5",
      "devices.kubevirt.io/kvm": "1k",
      "devices.kubevirt.io/sev": "0",
      "devices.kubevirt.io/tun": "1k",
      "devices.kubevirt.io/vhost-net": "1k",
      "ephemeral-storage": "33812468066",
      "hugepages-1Gi": "0",
      "hugepages-2Mi": "128Mi",
      "memory": "3783496Ki",
      "pods": "110"
   }
   ```

2. Check the node status conditions:

   ```bash
   $ oc get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/worker= -o json | jq '.items | \
     .[].status.conditions'
   ```

   Example output:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "lastHeartbeatTime": "2022-10-03T11:13:34Z",
       "lastTransitionTime": "2022-10-03T10:14:20Z",
       "message": "kubelet has sufficient memory available",
       "reason": "KubeletHasSufficientMemory",
       "status": "False",
       "type": "MemoryPressure"
     },
     {
       "lastHeartbeatTime": "2022-10-03T11:13:34Z",
       "lastTransitionTime": "2022-10-03T10:14:20Z",
       "message": "kubelet has no disk pressure",
       "reason": "KubeletHasNoDiskPressure",
       "status": "False",
       "type": "DiskPressure"
     },
     {
       "lastHeartbeatTime": "2022-10-03T11:13:34Z",
       "lastTransitionTime": "2022-10-03T10:14:20Z",
       "message": "kubelet has sufficient PID available",
       "reason": "KubeletHasSufficientPID",
       "status": "False",
       "type": "PIDPressure"
     },
     {
       "lastHeartbeatTime": "2022-10-03T11:13:34Z",
       "lastTransitionTime": "2022-10-03T10:14:30Z",
       "message": "kubelet is posting ready status",
       "reason": "KubeletReady",
       "status": "True",
       "type": "Ready"
     }
   ]
   ```

## Mitigation

Check the migration configuration of the virtual machine to ensure that it is
appropriate for the workload.

You set a cluster-wide migration configuration by editing the `MigrationConfiguration`
stanza of the `KubeVirt` custom resource.

You set a migration configuration for a specific scope by creating a migration
policy.

You can determine whether a VM is bound to a migration policy by viewing its
`vm.Status.MigrationState.MigrationPolicyName` parameter.

If you cannot resolve the issue, log in to the
[Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com) and open a support case,
attaching the artifacts gathered during the diagnosis procedure.
