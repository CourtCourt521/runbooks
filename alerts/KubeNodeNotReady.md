# KubeNodeNotReady

## Meaning

[This alert][KubeNodeNotReady] is fired when a Kubernetes node is not in `Ready`
state for a certain period. In this case, the node is not able to host any new
pods as described [here][KubeNode].

## Impact

The performance of the cluster deployments is affected, depending on the overall
workload and the type of the node.

## Diagnosis

The notification details should list the node that's not ready. For Example:

```txt
 - alertname = KubeNodeNotReady
...
 - node = node1.example.com
...
```

Login to the cluster. Check the status of that node:

```console
$ oc get node $NODE -o yaml
```

The output should describe why the node isn't ready (e.g.: timeouts reaching the
API or kubelet) Check the machine for the node:

```console
$ oc get -n openshift-machine-api machine $NODE -o yaml
```

and the events for the machine API:

```console
$ oc get -n openshift-machine-api events
```

If the machine API is not able to replace the node, the machine status and
events should detail why.

## Mitigation

Once, the problem was resolved that prevented the machine API from replacing the
node, the instance should be terminated and replaced by the machine API.
However, this is only the case `MachineHealthChecks` are enabled for the nodes
otherwise a manual restart is required.
