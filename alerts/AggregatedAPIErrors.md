# AggregatedAPIErrors

## Meaning

[This alert][AggregatedAPIErrors] is triggered when multiple calls to the
aggregated API of OpenShift fail over a certain period.

## Impact

Errors on the aggregated API can result in the unavailability of some OpenShift
services.  

## Diagnosis

The alert should contain information about the affected API and the scope of the
impact.

```text
 - alertname = AggregatedAPIErrors
 - name = v1.packages.operators.coreos.com
 - namespace = default
...
 - message = An aggregated API v1.packages.operators.coreos.com/default has reported errors. The number of errors have increased for it in the past five minutes. High values indicate that the availability of the service changes too often.
```

## Mitigation

### Check the APIs status checks are on True

Currently, there are at least four aggregated APIs in an OpenShift Cluster. The
API on the `openshift-apiserver` namespace, the prometheus-adapter on the
namespace `openshift-monitoring`, the package-server service in the
`openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager` namespace, and the API on the
`openshift-oauth-apiserver` namespace. However, it makes sense to check the
availability of all APIs.

To get a list of `APIServices` and their backing aggregated APIs, use the
following command:

```console
$ oc get apiservice 
```

The `SERVICE` column notes here the aggregated API name. The availability status
for every listed API should be `True`. A `False` means that requests for that
API service, API server pods, or resources belonging to that apiGroup failed
many times during the last minutes. For the case that the logs of the particular
pods should be investigated.

To get the pods that serve the `openshift-apiserver/api` can be fetched with the
following command:  

```console
$ oc get pods -n openshift-apiserver
```

If their status is not `Running`, check the logs for more details. As these pods
are controlled by a deployment, they can be restart in case they are not
answering requests anymore.

### Check the authentication certificates of the aggregated API

Make sure the certificates are up to date and still valid. Use:

```console
$ oc get configmaps -n kube-system extension-apiserver-authentication
```

you can save those certificates into a file and use the following command to
check the end dates:

```console
$ openssl x509 -noout -enddate -in {myfile_with_certs.crt}
```

Those certificates are used by the aggregated APIs to validate requests. For the
case, they are expired check [here][cert] how to add a new one.
